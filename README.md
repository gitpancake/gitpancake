#### Hello! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Henry. 

- 🚀 I am currently learning how to build an NFT marketplace that utilises the [Tezos Blockchain](https://tezos.com/) ☁️ in Berlin, Germany. 
- ⭐️ My primary languages are TypeScript, JavaScript and a _tiny_ bit of Python.
- 🙋🏽‍♂️ My focus at the moment is on Blockchain technologies, creating smart contracts in [solidity](http://solidity.com/) and creating dApps to contribute to web3.
- 💬 Fancy connecting? Send me a message over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-pye-9b170692/)!
- 🛠 I'm hosting an [IOTA Hornet Node](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/welcome). You can too - check out the [docs](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/getting_started)
